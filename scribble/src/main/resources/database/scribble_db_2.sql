Room\n-------------------------------\nThey called it Room Five.\n\nEvery door in Westwood Dorm had been opened—except one. Painted shut, padlocked, even bricked behind a shelf. But everyone whispered about it.\n\n“Someone screamed in there once,” said Jenny, the RA.\n\n“People disappear,” added Mark, her roommate.\n\nLena didn’t believe in ghost stories. She was new, skeptical, and curious. So, late one night, she sneaked out, flashlight in hand. The hallway felt colder than usual. The flickering lights above buzzed like whispers.\n\nShe stood before the sealed room, heart thumping. The number 5 was barely visible under layers of peeling paint. Her fingers tingled as she touched the doorknob—rusted shut.\n\nSuddenly, it clicked.\n\nThe lock… had just opened by itself.\n\nShe staggered back, but the door creaked open an inch, as if inviting her. From inside came the unmistakable sound of breathing. Heavy. Slow.\n\nShe leaned forward, trying to see.\n\nSilence.\n\nThen—\n\nA whisper.\n\n“Come in.”\n\nShe ran.','2025-06-28 19:56:34','2025-06-28 19:58:18'),(97,54,24,2,'Mirror Faces\nLena tried to tell Jenny, but she laughed it off. “You were just dreaming. That door hasn’t opened in decades.”\n\nBut Lena knew what she saw.\n\nThat night, the whispers returned. But now, they were everywhere—in the vents, behind the walls, in the mirror.\n\nAs she brushed her teeth, the bathroom mirror fogged over from steam. Words formed slowly:\n\n“You opened it.”\n\nShe wiped it away, only to find something else—her reflection wasn\'t matching her movements. It smiled when she didn’t. It blinked too late. She stepped back.\n\nHer reflection whispered: “Room Five is yours now.”\n\nThe lights flickered. Behind her, a shadow moved across the shower curtain. But when she turned, nothing was there.\n\nLena slept with the light on.\n\nBut she couldn’t stop the dreams—always the same hallway, always the fifth door opening wider.','2025-06-28 19:56:52','2025-06-28 19:56:52'),(98,54,24,3,'The Missing Ones\n------------------------\nThe next morning, Mark was gone.\n\nNo one had seen him leave. His phone, books, and jacket were still in his room. His bed untouched.\n\nThen it happened again.\n\nSasha from 2B. Then the tall kid from the cafeteria. Three students gone within a week. No forced entry. No noise. Just gone.\n\nLena scoured the internet. There had been eight disappearances in the past ten years from Westwood Dorm. All unsolved.\n\nThey had one thing in common: all stayed on the west hall, near Room Five.\n\nShe returned to the door—this time with a camera.\n\nThe door opened before she even touched it.\n\nInside, dust floated in the air like snow. The room was completely empty. No furniture. No bed. Just four blank walls.\n\nThen she realized—there were five walls.\n\nThe fifth wall had no window. No exit. Only a full-length mirror—and in it, Mark stood silently, staring back.','2025-06-28 19:57:17','2025-06-28 19:57:17'),(99,54,24,4,'Don’t Look Too Long\n------------------------------\nLena blinked.

The real room was empty.\n\nWhen she turned back to the mirror—she was in it. Looking into the dorm from the other side.\n\nNo sound. No escape.\n\nShe banged on the glass, but it echoed like stone. Mark grabbed her arm. “You looked too long,” he mouthed. “Now you’re one of us.”\n\nIn the real world, Lena’s body went still, eyes glazed. To everyone else, she had just collapsed. The nurse said she fainted. But her friends couldn’t wake her.\n\nInside the mirror, Lena watched the real world move on without her.\n\nShe wasn’t the last.','2025-06-28 19:57:40','2025-06-28 19:57:40');

19:08:27',5,'The Disappearing Light','Chapter 1: The Power Cut\nIt began with a blackout. Just past 11 p.m., the entire street plunged into darkness. Claire stood at her window, heart racing. The storm outside had raged for hours, but this silence felt unnatural. Across the street, Mr. Harold\'s porch light flickered, then died. Suddenly, a shadow darted across the sidewalk. Claire stepped back, breathing heavily. This wasn’t just a power failure—it felt like a warning. Grabbing her flashlight, she tiptoed to the basement, where the fuse box hummed. Just as she reached for the switch, a cold hand clamped down on her shoulder. She froze. The air smelled metallic. Turning around, no one was there. Only silence. She backed away slowly. Upstairs, the floorboards creaked. Someone was in the house. She turned off the flashlight and hid behind the furnace, clutching her phone with trembling fingers. No service. The darkness wasn’t empty—it was watching.\n\nChapter 2: Footsteps\nClaire held her breath as footsteps echoed above. Slow. Heavy. Deliberate. Her mind raced—was it a burglar, or something worse? A drawer opened upstairs. The intruder wasn’t searching quietly. Claire’s eyes scanned the basement, landing on her dad’s old crowbar. She crept to it, grasping the cold iron. Another step. Then two. The stairs creaked. Someone was coming down. Claire tucked into the shadows, heart pounding like a drum. The flashlight beam returned—this time not hers. It scanned the room, inching closer. The light paused, right over her. She gripped the crowbar. A deep voice spoke, “I know you’re here.” Claire sprang up, swinging. The flashlight dropped, crashing to the floor. She bolted past him, up the stairs, ignoring the yell behind her. Upstairs, the storm had stopped. But outside her window, a van with its engine running waited in the rain.\n\nChapter 3: The Van\nClaire didn’t stop to think. She slammed the front door behind her and ran into the rain. The van’s headlights blinded her for a moment. The driver’s side opened. A man stepped out—tall, soaked, wearing black gloves. Claire darted into the bushes. He called out, “Claire? Come on, we’re late.” Her blood froze. How did he know her name? She crawled farther into the hedge, clutching her phone. Still no signal. The man got back into the van but didn’t leave. He was waiting. Watching. She couldn’t go back inside, not with the intruder down there. Just then, a second shadow approached the van—from the alley. They exchanged words too low to hear. Claire used the distraction to run, barefoot, down the street. She didn’t stop until she reached Mrs. Ellie\'s house. Lights were on. Claire rang the bell. No answer. She turned. The van was now parked outside.\n\nChapter 4: The Letter\nMrs. Ellie’s door creaked open—unlocked. Claire entered slowly. “Hello?” No response. Her wet feet left prints on the wooden floor. The TV buzzed static. A mug of tea sat untouched on the table. Something felt off. On the counter, a note: “Claire, if you’re reading this, don’t trust the police. He’s one of them.” Claire’s breath caught. Was this for her? Who wrote it? She flipped the page. “They’re watching you. Meet me at the lighthouse. Midnight.” Signed: E. Claire backed toward the door. A thud came from the hallway. She ducked into the pantry just as a figure stepped into the kitchen. Through the cracks, she saw the glint of a badge. A police officer. Her heart pounded. Was he the one from the van? The officer walked around slowly, calling her name softly. Claire stayed silent. Midnight was three hours away. Could she survive until then?\n\nChapter 5: The Escape\nAs the officer searched, Claire spotted an old cellar door in the pantry floor. She quietly pulled it open and climbed down, careful not to let it slam. The darkness below smelled of dust and oil. She felt her way forward until she found a narrow exit—leading to the backyard shed. The rain had stopped. The van was gone. She made a run for it, cutting through alleys until she reached her father’s workshop. It had been locked since his death last year. But Claire remembered the code: 0423—his badge number. Inside, dusty blueprints, a hidden safe, and folders. She opened one marked “Project Light.” Inside: maps, photos of the town, and surveillance images—of her. One showed her from tonight. She stared in horror. A noise at the door. Someone was trying to open it. She slammed the folder shut and backed away, crowbar in hand.\n\nChapter 6: Project Light\nA voice called through the door. “Claire. Please. I’m not here to hurt you.” She didn’t recognize it. “I worked with your father. He knew they were coming. He tried to stop it.” Claire hesitated. “What’s Project Light?” she asked. Silence. Then, “It’s not a project. It’s a person. You.” The door creaked open slowly. A woman entered, hands raised. “I’m Ellie. The real one.” Claire stepped back. “I saw the note.” Ellie nodded. “He used to call you Light. You’re the only one who can expose them.” She handed Claire a flash drive. “Everything is here. But they know. You have until midnight. The lighthouse is the only safe signal zone left.” Claire took it, hand trembling. “What if they find me?” Ellie smiled grimly. “They already have.” Tires screeched outside. Lights blazed through the windows. The hunt was on. Claire bolted out the back door, drive in hand.\n\nChapter 7: The Lighthouse\nThe old lighthouse stood at the edge of the cliff, surrounded by crashing waves and wind. Claire reached it at 11:57 p.m. Her lungs burned. The flash drive felt hot in her hand. Inside, the beacon room was cold and damp. A terminal flickered to life as she plugged the drive in. Files loaded: names, operations, recordings—evidence of decades of corruption. Suddenly, footsteps echoed behind her. A man in uniform stepped in. “End of the line,” he said. “Your father was warned. Now it’s your turn.” Claire hit SEND. The files uploaded to a secure public server. Too late now. The man raised his weapon. A shot rang out—but not from him. He fell. Behind him, Ellie held the gun. “Told you I’d watch your back.” The beacon lit up, cutting through the fog. Sirens wailed in the distance. Claire had exposed the truth. The light was no longer disappearing.','ccp_9.png'),(70,2,12,'2025-06-22 19:27:42',1,'Echoes in the Ward','Chapter 1: Room 606\nNina entered St. Augustine’s Psychiatric Ward as part of her final year psychology internship. Assigned to file old patient records, she was told never to enter Room 606. Naturally, that’s where her curiosity took her. The door was sealed shut, rusted around the lock. But on the clipboard outside, she read: Patient: Evelyn Moss. Diagnosis: None. Status: Observed. The last note dated back 18 years. As she turned to leave, she heard it—three soft knocks from inside the room. Frozen, Nina stared at the door. Then again—three knocks. No one was supposed to be in there. She ran to the nurse’s station, asking about Evelyn. The head nurse went pale. “That room’s been empty for decades,” she whispered. “We don’t talk about Evelyn.” That night, in her dorm, Nina found a sticky note on her door. It read: You opened the door, now she knows your name.\n\nChapter 2: Evelyn’s Whisper\nSleep was impossible. Every time Nina closed her eyes, she heard a whisper. Faint. Repeating her name. Nina... Nina... The heater clicked on. The air turned cold. She sat up, scanning the room. Nothing. But her mirror was fogged—words written from the inside: Let me out. The next day, she confronted the head nurse. “Who was Evelyn Moss?” The nurse whispered, “She wasn’t sick. She was a key. A vessel.” That night, Nina snuck into the records room. The file had been shredded, but one photo remained. A girl with pale skin, eyes completely black. Scribbled beneath it: She’s still listening. Suddenly, all the lights went out. The air felt suffocating. From the dark corridor, a soft humming rose—a lullaby. Something moved past the records shelf. She bolted, but the door slammed shut behind her. In the silence, Evelyn whispered: It’s your turn now, Nina.\n\nChapter 3: The Black Tape\nThe janitor, a mute man named Gregor, found her trembling the next morning. “You were lucky,” the nurse said. “Most don’t make it through the night in that room.” Nina insisted she saw something—heard Evelyn. They dismissed her. Until she found the black cassette tape hidden in her locker. Labeled: “606: First Recording.” She found an old player and listened. A girl’s voice: “They keep me locked away. But I remember everything. They said I’m a danger to minds. But minds are easy to break.” The recording warped, then: “Nina, you’re just like me.” She dropped the tape. It cracked, oozing black fluid. Nina backed away. Gregor saw the mess and looked terrified. He scribbled a note: Don’t listen to the second tape. But there was no second tape… right? That night, one appeared on her pillow. Same black casing. Label: “606: Transfer Initiated.”\n\nChapter 4: Silent Screams\nNina burned the second tape. She watched it melt in the sink. The black ooze steamed and hissed. Still, that night, she had the dream. She was strapped to a hospital bed, Evelyn standing over her, eyes pure black, lips unmoving. Yet Nina heard: “Let’s switch now.” Waking in sweat, she found bruises on her wrists—like restraints had held her down. The staff noticed changes. Nina was quieter, eyes darker. She couldn’t explain it, even to herself. Her handwriting changed. Her memories blurred. Gregor cornered her in the corridor, showing an old photo: Evelyn as a teen—and someone standing beside her who looked exactly like Nina. But that was impossible. “She was waiting,” Gregor signed. “For a host. For you.” The mirrors began cracking when Nina passed. Lights flickered. She couldn’t sleep anymore. Evelyn was pushing closer. Her reflection now smiled back—when she didn’t.\n\nChapter 5: The Switch\nNina decided to end it. She returned to Room 606, crowbar in hand. She pried the door open. Inside, the room was pristine—untouched by time. A single chair, and a mirror bolted to the wall. Nothing else. She stepped in. The door closed behind her. In the mirror, Evelyn stood—not beside her, in place of her. The reflection spoke: “Now you understand. I never left. I was just waiting to be remembered.” Nina shouted, but no sound came. Her voice didn’t work. The real Nina watched as Evelyn smiled through her body—her own hands, her own eyes now moving without her. She was trapped. Inside the mirror. On the ward’s camera, staff saw Nina exit the room, calm, collected. Her eyes now pitch black. She signed the discharge papers. Evelyn walked free. And in Room 606, the mirror cracked... revealing Nina’s silent scream forever frozen inside.\n\nChapter 6: The New Patient\nTwo weeks later, a new intern arrived. The head nurse smiled politely. “You’ll be helping with storage. But one rule: stay away from Room 606.” The intern, curious, passed by the room anyway. The door was sealed—again. Clipboard blank. But as she leaned in, she heard soft humming. And three gentle knocks from inside. She shivered, walking away. In the mirror at the end of the hallway, a second reflection followed her. Behind the glass in Room 606, Nina stared. Her scream couldn’t escape. Her story couldn’t be told. But Evelyn’s could. And now, she was writing new chapters. One patient at a time.','ccp_10.png'),(71,2,30,'2025-06-22 19:34:08',4,'The Last Train South','Chapter 1: Final Departure\nMaya boarded the 10:46 p.m. southbound train from Platform 13. The station was unusually empty, despite the last-train rush. The conductor, tall and pale, barely looked at her as she passed. Her seat—Car B, Row 3—was empty. So was the entire car. As the train pulled away, the city lights vanished unnaturally fast. Fog thickened outside the windows. Maya texted her sister: \"On board. Strange vibe.\" No response. She turned to ask the conductor a question—but he was gone. Every car she passed was empty. No passengers. No crew. Just silence. Then the intercom crackled: “Next stop: Mercy Crossing.” She froze. That wasn’t a real station. She had never heard of it. Her phone died. A note fluttered from above her seat. In neat cursive: “You shouldn’t have come alone.” The lights flickered. The train picked up speed. Outside, she saw only dark woods.\n\nChapter 2: Mercy Crossing\nThe train jerked violently, throwing Maya from her seat. The lights dimmed to red emergency mode. The announcement repeated: “Approaching Mercy Crossing. Please remain seated.” Maya ran toward the nearest door, but it wouldn’t open. Outside, the forest gave way to mist-shrouded ruins. She spotted figures—motionless, lining the track. Not passengers. Not human. One turned. It had no eyes. Just a carved, gaping smile. The train screeched to a halt. Maya backed away as the figures began boarding. Their skin looked painted. They filed in silently, taking random seats. None looked at her. Then one did. It tilted its head and whispered, “This train runs on memory.” Maya’s breath caught. “What does that mean?” she asked. But the thing simply replied, “Yours is the last one.” Before she could react, the doors slammed shut. The train began moving again. The passengers all turned to face her in unison.\n\nChapter 3: Car B\nMaya locked herself in the restroom. Her heart pounded as she pressed her ear to the metal door. No sounds. No voices. Just the low hum of the train. When she emerged, all passengers were gone again. Only she remained. But the train looked different now—older, rusted, with flickering lights and peeling seats. On the wall, she saw faded graffiti: “WE NEVER GOT OFF.” She stumbled back into her seat and found a small cassette recorder on the tray. Pressing play, she heard her own voice: “If you’re listening to this… I didn’t make it off.” It continued: “You’ll see your memories before the end. Don’t believe them. Especially the girl.” Maya dropped the recorder. She didn’t remember ever saying that. She turned—and saw a child in the next row. Same eyes, same hair. The child smiled and whispered: “Let’s remember together.”\n\nChapter 4: The Memory Car\nThe child led Maya to the front of the train. Doors she couldn’t open earlier now swung freely. Inside, a movie reel flickered to life, showing Maya’s childhood. Then her sister’s funeral. Then her own accident—one she had no memory of. “You died,” the child whispered. “You just didn’t accept it.” Maya screamed. “I’m alive! I boarded this train!” The child touched her arm. Suddenly, Maya stood in her apartment, reliving her last morning—coffee, messages, rush to the train. But in the bathroom mirror that morning, her reflection hadn’t looked back. She hadn’t noticed. Now she did. The illusion shattered. Maya dropped to her knees in the train. “Why?” she asked. “Because the train helps us let go,” the child said. The passengers returned, now somber, gently watching her. The train slowed once more. Ahead: a glowing station bathed in soft light. The real last stop.\n\nChapter 5: The Conductor’s Choice\nThe conductor returned—face no longer pale, but serene. “You remembered,” he said softly. “Few do.” Maya stood, uncertain. “Where does this train go now?” He smiled. “Where it always does. Back to collect the lost.” As the doors opened at the glowing station, Maya hesitated. “Can I go back?” The child shook her head. “You already did. Every night. Until you saw the truth.” Maya stepped off. The air was warm, peaceful. Behind her, the train vanished into fog. Somewhere, in another city, someone else boarded the 10:46 southbound—alone. The cycle began again. But this time, Maya watched from the platform, no longer a passenger, but a guide. The last train south never truly ends. It only waits—for the next soul to remember.','ccp_11.png'),(72,2,31,'2025-06-22 19:38:14',3,'The Apartment Above','Chapter 1: Thumps at 3 A.M.\nEmma moved into her new apartment on the fifth floor, glad for independence. The rent was cheap, and the building was quiet—too quiet. The landlord casually said, “There’s no sixth floor, just a sealed attic.” Yet every night, at exactly 3 a.m., she heard loud thumps coming from above. Furniture scraping. Footsteps pacing. Once, even a soft cry. She asked the neighbor across the hall, an old woman named Mrs. Delarue, about it. The woman simply said, “Ignore it. Never knock back.” But one night, fed up, Emma grabbed a broom and banged on the ceiling. Silence followed—eerily calm. Then, precisely three minutes later, came three slow knocks from above. Heavy. Measured. Like a response. Her lights flickered. Then her phone rang—unknown number. When she answered, a child’s voice whispered, “Why did you wake me?” The call ended. Her ceiling cracked slightly, and dust fell.\n\nChapter 2: The Sixth Floor\nEmma couldn’t sleep. The knocking never returned—but now, the shadows in her room felt heavier. She checked the stairwell the next day and found something strange: the button for Floor 6 had been crudely pried off the elevator. Only five floors were supposed to exist. That evening, she followed a maintenance worker and asked about the top floor. He frowned. “There is no sixth floor. The building was designed with one, but it was sealed after… something happened.” He refused to say more. Back in her apartment, Emma used a broomstick to tap upward—six quick knocks. Immediately, she heard whispering from the ceiling. A chill ran down her spine. She turned to her door. Someone had slid a photo under it. A black-and-white image of a girl staring through an attic vent. On the back, in shaky writing: “She’s still there.” That night, the thumping returned.\n\nChapter 3: The Journal\nDetermined, Emma checked the building\'s archives at the public library. She found an old news clipping from 1982: “Child Found Dead in Sixth Floor Apartment—Parents Missing.” No names were listed. Back home, she returned to the storage space above her closet, where she\'d earlier noticed loose boards. Behind the wall insulation, she found a leather-bound journal. Inside were drawings—dark, frantic sketches of eyes and hands. The entries were from a girl named Lily. “They locked me in. They said the shadows would eat me. They lied. They became the shadows.” The last entry was almost illegible: “I’m not alone anymore. She whispers too.” That night, Emma dreamt of Lily—silent, pale, pointing upward. When Emma woke, her apartment door was wide open, and muddy child-sized footprints led to the ceiling vent. From inside, something breathed. Slowly. Waiting.\n\nChapter 4: The Vent\nEmma grabbed a flashlight and chair, unscrewing the ceiling vent. Dust choked her as she peeked inside. Beyond the duct was a narrow crawlspace leading toward the building’s top. Curiosity overpowering fear, she crawled in. The metal floor groaned beneath her. After ten minutes of crawling, she emerged into an attic-like space—Room 601, hidden above her apartment. Old toys, a crib, and moldy wallpaper surrounded her. In the corner sat a child’s mattress. Drawings covered the walls: “No light,” “Don’t knock,” “She walks backward.” Emma found an old mirror covered with cloth. She lifted it. Behind her, the reflection showed a girl standing—but when she turned around, no one was there. The mirror cracked. A whisper filled the room: “You saw me. Now I can follow.” Emma screamed and fled. But as she re-entered her apartment, she noticed a new drawing on her wall: her—sleeping.\n\nChapter 5: Don’t Wake Her\nEmma tried to leave the building. The elevator buttons glitched. The stairs led her back to the same floor every time. At 3 a.m., her apartment turned cold. Her reflection no longer moved in sync. She smashed the mirror—but her reflection kept staring. Desperate, she called Mrs. Delarue. The old woman sighed. “You shouldn’t have climbed. That floor was sealed for a reason.” Emma begged, “How do I stop it?” The woman whispered, “You can’t. Just don’t let her wake fully.” Emma locked every door and stayed awake all night. But exhaustion won. She fell asleep around 2:59 a.m. And then—three soft knocks. She opened her eyes. Standing at the foot of her bed was the girl—Lily. Except… her eyes were wrong. Not sad. Not scared. Hungry. She whispered, “Thanks for letting me in.” The lights went out.\n\nChapter 6: The New Tenant\nWeeks later, the apartment was listed for rent again. “Great view, very affordable,” said the agent. A young man moved in. On his first night, he asked about the attic noises. “Old pipes,” the landlord said. That night, at 3 a.m., came the thumping. He knocked the ceiling once in annoyance. Then again. Just to be funny. Then… silence. The power flickered. His phone vibrated. Unknown number: “Why did you wake me?” He laughed nervously. A faint giggle came from the vent above. When he turned off the lights, the reflection in the TV screen showed two people. He was alone. But she never was. Above him, Room 601 waited. And Lily smiled in the dark.','ccp_12.png'),(73,2,32,'2025-06-22 19:42:58',3,'The Sound of Glass','Chapter 1: Cracked\nAva worked as a night cleaner at the city museum. Quiet. Routine. Until the exhibit of antique mirrors arrived. One cracked mirror stood out—it didn’t reflect properly. Instead of her full body, it always showed her turned away. Her manager joked, “Probably cursed,” and moved on. But every night, Ava saw something move behind her reflection. A figure, dressed like her, but always five seconds late. One night, the reflection turned its head—before Ava did. She dropped her mop. The mirror cracked deeper. From that moment, strange things happened. Glasses in the café shattered when she walked by. Light bulbs burst. One night, her phone recorded a voice: “You cracked it open. Now I see too.” Her reflection no longer copied her. It watched her. Then smiled. When Ava blinked, her reflection didn’t. That’s when she stopped looking into any glass at all.\n\nChapter 2: Room of Mirrors\nThe museum’s power went out the next night. Ava was alone. The mirror exhibit glowed faintly, though unplugged. She crept closer. The cracked mirror now reflected a room—not the one she stood in. Inside the reflection, dozens of Ava’s stood in identical poses. But one in the back slowly raised its hand and waved. Ava didn’t move. Her chest tightened. Suddenly, she heard a tap-tap-tap from behind the glass. The sound of glass fingernails. Then a whisper from behind her: “Closer.” She turned, nothing there. But in the mirror, one version of her began walking forward—closer to the glass. Its eyes were missing. Instead, deep black holes. When she stepped back, the mirror vibrated. One by one, other mirrors cracked around her. A storm of reflections, all out of sync. They whispered, in unison: “The real one must break.” Ava ran. But her reflection stayed.\n\nChapter 3: Shatterpoint\nAva decided to destroy the cracked mirror. She grabbed a hammer from the maintenance shed. But when she returned, the mirror was gone. A note on the exhibit wall read: “Donated to Room 413.” But the museum only had 4 floors. Confused, Ava descended to the basement—where unused exhibit pieces were stored. Room 413 had no key, only a padlock with symbols instead of numbers. On the wall next to it: a sketch of her own face. She entered the combination instinctively. Inside: a massive mirror wall, with one cracked panel in the center. As she approached, her reflection was already there—smiling. “It’s your turn,” it whispered. Then reached through. Ava screamed as her feet locked in place. Her skin numbed. Her reflection stepped out, smoothing its new body. “Real enough,” it said. Ava’s voice echoed inside the glass, now trapped. Her eyes turned black.\n\nChapter 4: The Exhibit\nThe museum reopened the next day. “The Reflection Room” was the new attraction. Visitors walked through smiling, taking selfies. But if you stayed past closing, the reflections stayed too long. Moved when you didn’t. Smiled at things you hadn’t noticed. And sometimes, if you looked close enough, one mirror didn’t reflect the exhibit at all—it showed a girl screaming behind glass. No one heard her. Only the sound of faint tapping. The cracked mirror sat in the middle of the display. Its label read: “Don’t Look Too Long.” People thought it was a joke. But late at night, after the janitor swept the floors and silence returned, a voice would whisper behind the glass: “Your turn is coming.” And somewhere inside, Ava still watched. And waited.','ccp_13.png'),(74,1,26,'2025-06-22 19:51:40',6,'The Feather of Fire','Chapter 1: Ember\'s Secret\nEmber always burned hotter than others. Not just temper—her skin sparked flames when she felt fear. She kept gloves on, always. But after saving a falling hawk with flaming hands, she found a golden feather in her palm. It whispered, \"Ignite.\" That night, her window glowed red. Something ancient was calling her name.\n\nChapter 2: The Phoenix Mark\nThe golden feather melted into her skin, branding her wrist with fire. Ember felt no pain—only clarity. Flames obeyed her now. She hid it from her father, but the forest near town burned a perfect circle. Villagers murmured of Phoenix magic. Ember wasn’t the only one watching the flames. A hunter in a dark cloak followed.\n\nChapter 3: Trial by Flame\nThe hunter found her by the river, where steam rose from her footprints. “The Phoenix chose you,” he said. “But fire tests loyalty.” He lit a torch and handed her a map of the Dead Peaks. “Go there. Alone.” Ember accepted. At midnight, fire leapt from her hands like wings. She didn’t walk—she flew.\n\nChapter 4: Ash Spirits\nThe Dead Peaks moaned with wind. Ember\'s fire dimmed. Shadows circled—ash spirits, memories of failed Phoenix heirs. They whispered doubts, clawed her mind. Ember fell to her knees. But then she remembered the hawk, its faith. Her fire reignited—not from rage, but resolve. The spirits fled. She passed the trial. The sky welcomed her.\n\nChapter 5: Rise, Phoenix\nAt the summit, the original Phoenix circled overhead—massive, golden, eternal. “You kept compassion,” it said. “Others kept power.” It burst into flame, diving into her chest. Ember gasped. Wings of fire spread from her back. She was no longer hiding. The world would remember the Phoenix.

Leaves fell, gold and red, endlessly. The last green tree stood in silence. Sylas, a young druid, guarded it. One day, a leaf shimmered silver and dropped. Sylas caught it. It pulsed like a heartbeat. The wind spoke, “Plant me in the frostlands.” Sylas set out before the snow came.\n\nChapter 2: The Frostlands\nSnow blinded him. Wolves circled. Sylas whispered to the silver leaf, and vines burst from the ground, shielding him. He reached the heart of the Frostlands—ice fields cracked like glass. He planted the leaf. The ground trembled. A green sprout pierced through the ice. Life returned. But something beneath the frost stirred. Eyes opened.\n\nChapter 3: The Waking Cold\nA giant of ice emerged—ancient and angry. “You break my slumber with spring?” it roared. Sylas stood firm. “Elwyn dies if this doesn’t grow.” The giant raised its blade. But the sprout shimmered, transforming into a tree of stars. The cold faded. The giant wept, turned to frost, and slept once more. Peace returned.\n\nChapter 4: Elwyn Blooms Again\nBack in Elwyn, the silver leaf’s magic spread. Trees bloomed green. Autumn broke. Children danced in sun-warmed meadows. Sylas stood beneath the new Star Tree, leaves glowing in many colors. “You listened to the wind,” it whispered. “So we live.” Elwyn breathed again.

Somewhere, someone else felt it stir. They were not friendly.\n\nChapter 2: Gears and Flames\nThe dragon, named Crix, couldn’t breathe fire. “You must find my core,” it said. Jorah found old blueprints in the attic. A map of the Sky Foundry—now abandoned. Clockwork knights guarded its secrets. Jorah and Crix set off by steam glider. Every turn of Crix’s gears felt warmer. Time was ticking. Enemies followed.\n\nChapter 3: Sky Foundry\nThe Foundry rose above clouds, floating on iron wings. Crix trembled. “It began here.” They entered. Machines still moved, long-forgotten. In the center, a core chamber glowed. But a masked man blocked them—Ashbinder, the one who stole Crix’s heart. “You fixed him,” he sneered. “I’ll break him again.” Crix growled. Jorah tightened his grip.\n\nChapter 4: Clockwork War\nAshbinder summoned broken dragons—metal, monstrous. Crix fought, gears grinding, wings blazing. Jorah reached the heart chamber, restored the core. Light burst from Crix’s chest. Fire roared. The enemy melted. The Foundry began to collapse. Jorah jumped on Crix’s back. “Time to fly,” Crix said. They soared through smoke, leaving ruin behind. The sky applauded.\n\nChapter 5: Sparks of Tomorrow\nBack in the city, Jorah opened a new shop: “Crix & Co. – Wonders Repaired.” Kids brought broken toys, dreams, and ideas.

He vowed to reclaim his throne, even if no one remembered who he was.\n\nChapter 2: A Witch in Red\nCael found a witch who remembered. “I cast the curse, but not for gold,” she said. “Your kindness saved me once.

Room 104 stayed quiet—but full. Sam painted clouds. A girl wrote haikus. A boy read comics. Nobody had to perform. Nobody had to explain. Quiet became power, not absence.\n\nChapter 3: Loud Days\nOne day, a fire drill broke their meeting. Chaos, noise, shouting. Sam panicked. Outside, the club members gathered under a tree. They didn’t speak—but handed each other pages, poems, and pictures. Silence returned. Calm followed. They rebuilt the club’s peace. Together.\n\nChapter 4: Quiet Shouts Back\nTheir school newspaper mocked them: “The Awkward Club.” Sam made a poster: “Silence is strength.” Dozens signed it. The paper printed an apology. The club grew. They got their own room—bigger, brighter. Still silent. Still strong.\n\nChapter 5: A Place to Breathe\nYears later, Sam visited Room 104 again. New students now. Still quiet. Still drawing, writing, building peace. He smiled.

He showed her a map that moved like constellations. “Each Moonbound must awaken their star,” he said. “Or darkness spreads.” Lyra followed him across floating islands and silent deserts, each night’s moon leading their way.\n\nChapter 3: Eclipse Trial\nTo awaken her star, she entered the Moon Mirror. Inside was herself—shadowed and angry. “You’re weak,” it said. Lyra stood tall. “But I’m real.” The mirror shattered. Her star ignited. Powers bloomed. Light wings. Star-blades. A true Moonbound.\n\nChapter 4: Darkfall Rises\nThe sky cracked. Creatures fell from the stars—Darkfall. “They hunt light,” Caden warned. “They fear you.” Lyra faced them with courage, holding the moonlight in her hands. “Then let them run.” She shined brighter.\n\nChapter 5: The Broken Moon\nThe moon itself dimmed. “They’re stealing it,” Caden said. Lyra flew to its surface, battling the last shadow king. He nearly broke her. But her star flared. She poured her light into the moon’s core. “Be whole again.”\n\nChapter 6: Sky Guardian\nThe sky healed. The stars sang. Lyra was crowned Sky Guardian—the youngest ever. She looked down at Earth and whispered, “Shine for them.” And the moon did. Every night. Just like her.','ccp_39.png');
